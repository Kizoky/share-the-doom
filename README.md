# Postal 2: Share the Doom

GZDoom 4.3+ or LZDoom 3.85 is required to run this mod! Vulkan renderer is recommended!!

If you have downloaded the mod from here, run ***build.bat*** or ***build*** if you are on Unix, this will build a ***.pk3*** file for you, alternative option is you can just simply drag the folder over ***GZDoom.exe***, just *make sure* the folder in the root has STD's content (so they aren't in an another folder)

### Status: Unfinished

**Note:** Multiplayer works, but it's recommended to ***only play on Doom levels***

# Postal 2: Share the Doom

GZDoom 4.7.0+ is required to run this mod! Vulkan renderer is recommended if you have more than 4GB RAM!

If you have downloaded the mod from here, on Windows: run build.bat - otherwise on Linux just do `bash build` this will build a GZPostal.pk3 for you.

### Welcome to Sindum

After Dude being kicked into a portal, he's being forced to do decade old chores that are no longer funny...

What will happen in this cursed land?

### Status: Unfinished

**Note:** Multiplayer works, but it's recommended to ***only play on Doom levels***
